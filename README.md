# micro-credentials

Our main motivation behind this project is being able to study and analyze how we can make use of decentralized systems to create an architecture capable of sustaining Self-Sovereign identity and contemplate whether or not these systems are able to keep our information safe.

* The university plays the role of the issuer, defining the schema and issuing micro-credentials using the aforementioned schema.
* The student plays the role of the holder, he will store the micro-credentials the university issued and use them as they see fit, changing the presentation of the micro-credential as he wants to keep private information safe.
* The company will act as a verifier, it will receive the micro-credential the student presented and check its veracity.
* The micro-credentials we will be using will be the certificates an university emits, such as degrees, masters and doctorates.
